# eWe
Empowerment of Women Entrepreneurship (eWe) is a platform which was established with the single goal of “empowering young girls and women” and aim at equipping underprivileged women in rural societies with the necessary foundation to assume a more productive role in their respective homes and communities. This eWe platform mainly focusing on increasing entrepreneurship among women in the textile industry. So, women who know and do not know tailoring can make use of eWe’s online training and assistance platform. They are also given the basic support and entrepreneurship training through this platform itself. Those women who are interested in starting small home based shops are also supported by eWe. Primary training includes online and digital marketing and sales using these services, along with marketing training, finance and accounting. eWe does not face the pits and falls of a wholesale business and traditional offline stores and does not require huge capital investment to run a home based shop. Mainly based on online platforms, the project does not necessitate taking huge risks on the part of the women. The eWe platform can be introduced at kudumbasree level through panchayath. 

Here the organisation wants to support women who are interested in starting small home based clothing outlets and virtual shops to start a business with a very low working capital investment. This platform is supporting the women entrepreneurs in the following ways: 

To give options for women using technology platform for online marketing and sales. 

To have a business without a much physical stock but need to take stock only as per order with the support of technology 

To identify customers through a digital platform 

To facilitate all the functions of a local shop through a virtual platform with digital background.
